# Advent Of Code 2022

This repository was generated using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] by JetBrains and will house my solutions for the puzzles in this year's Advent of Code[^aoc] Challenge. I'll be using [Kotlin][kotlin] this year and hope to get further than I did [last year][lastyearAoC] - but no promises! Can sometimes get hard with work and other general life stuff. 

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
